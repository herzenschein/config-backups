# My huge small list of apps with blatant preference for Qt and Electron over GTK*.
Yes. Even Java is preferable. I'm that fanboy-ish.

Also, it's actually easier to list everything in this same README file.

## Applications that need configuration

Falkon -- I just need opendyslexic.css to live

Scribus from Master -- I literally svn co this wonderful publishing software

Kontact -- It works, y'know, and I love it

## Downloadable applications

Discord -- Proprietary, but I actually have friends. https://discordapp.com/download

MellowPlayer -- It's a must for Soundcloud. https://colinduquesnoy.gitlab.io/MellowPlayer/

PopcornTime -- I almost never use it, only as a last resource, and not even in this case. https://itsfoss.com/popcorn-time-ubuntu-linux/

SoftmakerOffice -- I like their company, they're German, linux-friendly AND translator-friendly. https://www.softmaker.com/en/applications

Etcher -- Might be Electron, but replaces gnome-disk-utility nicely. https://dl.bintray.com/etcher/debian/

Haguichi -- For long-distance support. https://launchpad.net/~webupd8team/+archive/ubuntu/haguichi/+packages

GBStudio -- Through Steam, but still. Awesome gameboy engine.

Aseprite -- Through Steam too, yeah, awesome pixelart software.

## Repository applications

Aegisub -- For subtitles

Focuswriter -- Because typewriter sounds are awesome and non-distracting at all

MediathekView -- For my German-language TV shows

Konversation -- For Anthrochat and Freenode, but mostly Anthrochat

JOSM -- For OpenStreetMap

Steam -- Obviously

Telegram Desktop -- Obviously

Inkscape -- Because of inkscape-tutorials

Krita -- It's a must

Scribus -- To verify old translations of this wonderful publishing software

LibreOffice -- Version 6.3 is finally usable! Just needs track changes with balloons now

Filelight -- Because .Xsessionerrors and logs can be a pain filling storage space in a small SSD

Gimp -- Actually not, just for curiosity sake

KCharSelect -- For Unicode referencing!

Kdenlive -- I may not know how to do it, but I sure like it because it's kool

Kile -- For awesome LaTeX! Requires texlive-publishers for abnTeX2

Kompare -- For showing off how much I proofread your text, you know!

Ktorrent -- It downloads really fast

Ktouch -- I really need to learn typing correctly...

Lokalize -- Gotta contribute to KDE after all!

Manuskript -- Sometimes I get urges and desires, I express them on the paper
