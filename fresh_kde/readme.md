# Ye ol' trusty KDE defaults!
This folder contains defaults of a KDE installation.
It also includes a stylesheet (css) for Falkon, overriding fonts to OpenDyslexic.
Below the OpenDyslexic code lies a random compilation of code to make websites dark.

org.kubuntu.desktop is the Kubuntu theme folder. Put it under ~/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/ if you want it to be local or under /usr/share/plasma/look-and-feel/
